# Last Epoch Defensive Strategies Guide

> **Note**: All values shown are calculated for Area Level 100. Lower area levels will have different scaling.

## Base Defense Systems

These form the foundation of every character's survivability:

### Health
- **Primary health pool** that determines how much damage you can take
- **Critical stat** - all builds need sufficient health to survive

### Health Regeneration
- **Passive recovery** that restores health over time
- **Sustain mechanism** for consistent healing between combat encounters

### Ward
- **Secondary protection layer** that absorbs damage before health
- **Decay mechanic**: Ward naturally decreases over time
- **Ward Retention**: Can be increased to slow decay rate
- **Usage**: Primarily used by caster builds and some hybrid builds

## Primary Defense Types

Choose ONE of these as your main defensive strategy:

## Armor Defense

### Mechanics
- **Function**: Reduces damage from all direct hits
- **Limitation**: Does NOT reduce damage over time effects
- **Efficiency**: Only 70% effective against non-physical damage types

### Effectiveness Caps
- **Maximum**: Hard-capped at 85% damage reduction
- **Scaling**: Diminishing returns as you approach the cap

### Armor Rating Examples (Area Level 100)
- **1,000 armor** = 23.7% damage reduction
- **10,000 armor** = 77.3% damage reduction ⭐ *Recommended minimum*
- **50,000 armor** = 84.4% damage reduction

---

## Dodge Defense

### Mechanics
- **Function**: Chance to completely avoid incoming attacks
- **All-or-nothing**: Either dodge completely or take full damage
- **Enemy scaling**: Dodge chance reduced by area level of enemies

### Effectiveness Caps
- **Maximum**: Hard-capped at 85% dodge chance
- **Scaling**: Diminishing returns as you approach the cap

### Dodge Rating Examples (Area Level 100)
- **1,000 dodge rating** = 29.1% dodge chance
- **10,000 dodge rating** = 81.6% dodge chance ⭐ *Recommended minimum*
- **50,000 dodge rating** = 84.6% dodge chance

---

## Block Defense

### Mechanics
- **Two components**: Block Chance (%) + Block Effectiveness (rating)
- **Function**: Reduces damage by effectiveness percentage when blocking occurs
- **Requirement**: Must use shield or specific weapon types
- **Enemy scaling**: Block effectiveness reduced by area level of enemies

### Effectiveness Caps
- **Maximum**: Hard-capped at 85% damage reduction when blocking
- **Scaling**: Diminishing returns on effectiveness rating

### Block Effectiveness Examples (Area Level 100)
- **2,500 effectiveness** = 55% damage reduction when blocking
- **5,000 effectiveness** = 71% damage reduction when blocking ⭐ *Recommended minimum*
- **10,000 effectiveness** = 80% damage reduction when blocking

---

## Secondary Defense (Mandatory)

## Resistance System

### Resistance Types
Last Epoch has **7 resistance types** total:

#### Elemental Resistances (3 types)
- **Fire Resistance**
- **Lightning Resistance**
- **Cold Resistance**
- **Group affixes**: Some gear provides "Elemental Resistances" affecting all three

#### Non-Elemental Resistances (4 types)
- **Physical Resistance**
- **Poison Resistance**
- **Necrotic Resistance**
- **Void Resistance**

#### Universal Resistance
- **"All Resistances"** affects all 7 resistance types

### Resistance Mechanics
- **Default cap**: 75% resistance maximum
- **Over-cap potential**: Cap can be modified through certain means
- **Enemy penetration**: Enemies penetrate 1% resistance per area level (up to 75% penetration at area level 75+)
- **Penetration application**: Applied AFTER the resistance cap, making over-cap valuable
- **Negative resistance**: Can be reduced below 0%, causing increased damage taken

### Resistance Strategy
- **Minimum target**: 75% in all relevant resistances
- **Endgame target**: 85-90% total resistance (10-15% over-cap)
- **Priority order**:
    1. Elemental Resistances (Fire, Lightning, Cold)
    2. Physical Resistance
    3. Poison, Necrotic, Void (based on content being faced)

## Tertiary Defense (Optional)

## Endurance System

### Mechanics
- **Function**: Percentage-based damage reduction for smaller hits
- **Threshold system**: Only applies to hits below the endurance threshold
- **Use case**: Effective for builds that maintain consistent health levels

### Example
- **25% endurance** with **100 threshold** = Any hit dealing less than 100 damage gets reduced by 25%
- **Effectiveness**: Best for characters with high health pools and good sustain

## Defensive Strategy Selection Guide

### Armor-Based Builds
- **Best for**: Melee characters, high-health builds
- **Strengths**: Consistent reduction, good against physical damage
- **Weaknesses**: Reduced effectiveness vs elemental damage, no DoT protection
- **Target**: 10,000+ armor rating

### Dodge-Based Builds
- **Best for**: Mobile characters, kiting builds
- **Strengths**: Complete damage avoidance when successful
- **Weaknesses**: Unreliable, no protection when dodge fails
- **Target**: 10,000+ dodge rating

### Block-Based Builds
- **Best for**: Shield users, defensive-focused builds
- **Strengths**: Reliable partial reduction, works with shields
- **Weaknesses**: Equipment restrictions, requires two stats (chance + effectiveness)
- **Target**: High block chance + 5,000+ block effectiveness

### Resistance Priority (All Builds)
- **Essential**: 75% minimum in all resistances
- **Recommended**: 85-90% for endgame content
- **Critical**: Account for enemy resistance penetration at high area levels
