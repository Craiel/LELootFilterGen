# Last Epoch Game Rules

## Character Power Systems

Character power is driven by five interconnected systems:

1. **Passive Trees** - Skill point allocation for permanent bonuses
2. **Skill Specializations** - Focused development of specific abilities
3. **Skill Specialization Trees** - Detailed customization within specialized skills
4. **Items** - Equipment that provides stats and modifiers
5. **Idols** - Special socketed items that provide targeted bonuses

## Class & Mastery System

### Class Structure
- Each class has **3 Masteries** available
- Each class has **4 Passive Trees**:
    - 3 mastery-specific trees (one per mastery)
    - 1 class-generic tree (shared across all masteries)

### Mastery Selection Rules
- **Main Mastery**: Only **one** mastery can be chosen as the main focus
- **Cross-Mastery Skills**: Can access the **first 2 skills** from non-chosen masteries
- **Skill Restrictions**: Cannot access the **last 2 skills** from non-chosen masteries

### Passive Point Allocation
- **Main Mastery**: **No limitations** on passive point allocation
- **Non-Main Masteries**: Can only allocate points to the **first half** of the passive tree
- **Point Requirements**: Some passives require specific point investments
- **Prerequisites**: Some passives require other passives to reach certain levels first

---

## Skill Specialization System

### Specialization Limits
- Maximum of **5 skills** can be specialized simultaneously
- Skill modifications targeting non-specialized skills are **wasted**

### Skill Levels
- **Default maximum level**: 20
- **Level increases**: Can exceed 20 with "+to skill" items and affixes

### Specialization Trees
- Each specialized skill has its own **specialization tree**
- Trees contain multiple **sub-nodes** for customization
- **Allocation Order**: Nodes must be allocated in pre-defined order
- **Multi-Point Nodes**: Some nodes require multiple points to fully unlock

---

## Item & Affix System

### Affix Structure
- **Default Affix Capacity**: Items can have **4 Affixes** by default
    - **2 Prefixes** - Modifiers that appear before the item name
    - **2 Suffixes** - Modifiers that appear after the item name
- **Affix Uniqueness**: Each item can only have **one instance** of any specific affix type
- **Sealed Affixes**: Special affixes that **cannot be modified** through crafting or other means

### Affix Tiers
- **Tier Range**: Affixes come in **Tiers 1-8** (with potential for future expansion)
- **Tier 1**: Lowest power level with minimal stat ranges
- **Tier 8**: Highest power level with maximum stat ranges
- **Non-Overlapping Values**: A low-roll higher tier is **always better** than a high-roll lower tier
    - Example: A minimum Tier 5 affix > maximum Tier 4 affix

### Affix Availability
- **Tiers 1-5**: Available through both **crafting** (maximum Tier 5) and **item drops**
- **Tiers 6-8**: **Drop-only** affixes that cannot be crafted
- **Value Scaling**: Each tier above 6 becomes increasingly more **valuable and powerful**
- **Rarity**: Higher tiers (6+) are considered **premium** modifiers

### Set Item Affixes
- Special Affixes that typically end in " Reforged" and incorporate a set bonus of the set that item (name) belongs to
- Only one affix of the set is needed to get the bonus, multiple of the same set do not add anything
- These Affixes can only be crafted onto items and do not Drop naturally in the current game version
