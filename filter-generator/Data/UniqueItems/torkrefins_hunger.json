  "lore": "The nomads around lake Mawn were optimistic as Grand Matriarch Torkrefin rose to power among the nearby Wengari. She had at first seemed more civilised than the average Wengari, carrying a giant sword instead of a crude axe or club. Nevertheless she proved particularly difficult to reason with on account of her propensity to devour their envoys."
