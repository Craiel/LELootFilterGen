# Build Generation Insights

This file captures high-level patterns and insights discovered during build analysis processes. Claude should update this file after each successful build analysis.

## Skill Synergy Discoveries

### Recently Discovered Patterns
*(Claude will update this section)*

- **Pattern**: [Skill combinations that work well together]
- **Build Types**: [Which build archetypes benefit]
- **Affix Priority**: [Key affixes for these synergies]
- **Analysis Date**: [When discovered]

### Validated Synergies
*(Move successful patterns here from recent discoveries)*

## Multi-Build Optimization Techniques

### Cross-Build Compatibility Patterns
*(Claude will document successful multi-build strategies)*

### Equipment Overlap Optimization
*(Document successful equipment sharing between builds)*

### Rule Efficiency Patterns
*(Document rule patterns that work well across multiple builds)*

## Build Type Classification Insights

### Minion Builds
- **Key Characteristics**: Primary skill is minion summoning, player acts as support
- **Essential Affixes**: Minion damage, minion health, minion resistances - NOT player damage stats
- **Unique Item Dependencies**: Items that enhance minion capabilities or enable additional minions
- **Scaling Priorities**: Minion stats > Player survivability > Player damage (minion builds ignore most player damage scaling)
- **Companion Survivability**: Primalist companions (Bear, Wolf, etc.) are very tanky and rarely die - moderate minion health investment sufficient
- **Mana Priority**: Very low for most minion builds since summons are persistent and cast infrequently
- **Analysis Date**: 2025-08-29
