# Sample Filters

This directory contains example loot filter files for various Last Epoch builds and archetypes.

## Purpose

Sample filters serve as:
- **Learning Examples**: Understanding how different builds prioritize loot
- **Reference Material**: Patterns and strategies for filter generation
- **Quality Benchmarks**: Comparison standards for generated filters

## Documentation Structure âœ… IMPLEMENTED

Each sample filter now has three files organized together:

### File Organization (Current Implementation)
- **`FilterName.xml`** - The actual loot filter file
- **`FilterName.analysis.md`** - Detailed technical analysis including:
  - Build archetype and strategy
  - Rule-by-rule breakdown
  - Technical implementation patterns
  - Strengths, limitations, and learning insights
- **`FilterName.build.json`** - Meta build file in the proposed JSON format for generation system testing

### Example File Set
```
Acolyte - Necromancer - Arcane Servants.xml
Acolyte - Necromancer - Arcane Servants.analysis.md
Acolyte - Necromancer - Arcane Servants.build.json
```

This organization keeps all related files together for easy cross-reference and maintains clear separation between the actual filter, its analysis, and its meta build representation.

## Sample Filter Categories

### By Class
- **Acolyte**: Death Knight, Necromancer, Warlock builds
- **Mage**: Runemaster, Sorcerer, Spellblade builds  
- **Primalist**: Beast Master, Druid, Shaman builds
- **Rogue**: Bladedancer, Marksman builds
- **Sentinel**: Forge Guard, Paladin, Void Knight builds

### By Playstyle
- **Melee Builds**: Close combat focused filters
- **Ranged Builds**: Projectile and spell focused filters
- **Minion Builds**: Pet-focused build filters
- **Hybrid Builds**: Multi-approach build filters

### By Progression Stage
- **Campaign**: Leveling and story progression
- **Early Endgame**: Monolith progression
- **Late Endgame**: High corruption pushing
- **Crafting Focus**: Specific crafting material priorities

## Adding Sample Filters

To add a new sample filter:

1. **Add the XML file** to this directory with a descriptive name
2. **Document the filter** (see structure above)
3. **Test the filter** in-game to verify effectiveness
4. **Update this README** if using the single-file approach

## Filter Analysis

When analyzing sample filters, consider:
- **Rule Count**: How close to the 75-rule limit
- **Priority Order**: Which items are filtered first
- **Affix Focus**: What stats are prioritized
- **Base Type Coverage**: Which item categories are included
- **Unique Item Handling**: How named items are managed

## Learning Objectives

From these samples, the generator should learn:
- Rule prioritization strategies
- Affix selection patterns
- Class-specific requirements
- Progression-appropriate filtering
- Efficient rule usage within the 75-rule limit
