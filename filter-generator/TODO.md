# Filter Generation Implementation Plan

**Status: Phase 1 Completed - Ready for Generation System Implementation**  
**Last Updated: 2025-08-27 (Phase 1 Complete)**

Now that we have the Data in place we can start working on the filter generation, this will be an incremental process and done in several steps.

## Phase 1: Filter Analysis & Documentation ✅ COMPLETED

### ✅ Task Organization Completed
- [x] **Task Analysis**: Organized TODO items into logical phases
- [x] **Progress Tracking**: Set up todo list with clear milestones

### ✅ Implementation Tasks Completed

1. **✅ Analyze Sample Filters** - COMPLETED 2025-08-27
   - ✅ Created individual `.analysis.md` files next to each sample filter
   - ✅ Created corresponding `.build.json` files for each analyzed filter
   - ✅ Documented build archetypes, strategies, and rule priorities for key sample filters
   - ✅ Identified common patterns and design insights across different filter philosophies
   - ✅ Analyzed rule efficiency and strictness levels

2. **✅ Create Filter Format Documentation** - COMPLETED 2025-08-27
   - ✅ Built `docs/FILTER_FORMAT.md` with complete XML structure documentation
   - ✅ Documented rule types, conditions, and properties comprehensively
   - ✅ Separate from `FILTER_DESIGN.md` (format vs strategy)
   - ✅ Includes validation rules and technical constraints

3. **✅ Cross-Reference Database Data** - COMPLETED 2025-08-27
   - ✅ Compared filter content against available database in `Data/`
   - ✅ Identified critical data gaps and affix ID mismatches
   - ✅ Analyzed subtype information gaps (0 subtypes discovered)

4. **✅ Document Missing Data** - COMPLETED 2025-08-27
   - ✅ Created `docs/FILTER_DATA_MISSING.md` tracking all data gaps
   - ✅ Identified critical issues: subtype data missing, affix ID mismatches
   - ✅ Prioritized data gaps with impact analysis and workaround strategies

## Phase 2: Meta Build System Design ✅ COMPLETED

5. **✅ Design Meta Build Format** - COMPLETED 2025-08-27
   - ✅ Created `docs/META_BUILD_FORMAT.md` with comprehensive JSON format
   - ✅ Includes core skills, equipment priorities, scaling methods, defensive strategies
   - ✅ References `FILTER_DESIGN.md` principles and supports strictness levels
   - ✅ Designed to stay within 75-rule limit with progressive requirements

6. **✅ Validate Meta Build Format** - COMPLETED 2025-08-27
   - ✅ Created `test-builds/necromancer-arcane-servants.json` test build
   - ✅ Built `docs/META_BUILD_VALIDATION.md` comparing format against sample filters
   - ✅ Verified 70% pattern coverage with identified critical gaps
   - ✅ Confirmed format viability with enhancement recommendations

## Phase 3: Filter Generation System Implementation (NEXT PHASE)

**Status**: Ready to begin implementation with solid foundation

### Critical Prerequisites Identified
1. **Subtype Database Completion**: Must resolve 0 subtypes discovered
2. **Affix ID Correction**: Fix mismatched affix mappings (IDs 28, 36, 25, 102)
3. **Rule Generation Templates**: Create pattern-based generation system

### Implementation Priority
1. **Data Quality**: Address critical data gaps first
2. **Basic Generation**: Implement 70% coverage patterns
3. **Enhanced Features**: Add missing pattern support

**Next Action**: Address critical data quality issues before implementing generation system. Cannot generate reliable filters with current data gaps.
