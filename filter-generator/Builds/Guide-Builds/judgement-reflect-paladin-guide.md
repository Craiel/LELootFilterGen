## **Unique Item Crafting Guide**

### **Mandatory Items Crafting:**

**Thicket of Blinding Light (Body Armor):**
- **Priority 1:** T7 Flat Damage Reflected to Attackers (12-20) - Massively scales reflect damage
- **Priority 2:** T7 Health (66-110) - Survivability is crucial
- **Alternative:** T7 +Level of Judgement (1-2) - Direct skill scaling

**Special Behavior:** Every 0.5 seconds, blinds all enemies facing you and deals damage equal to your "Damage Reflected to Attackers" stat. This is your primary boss damage source due to the (329-401%) more damage to bosses multiplier.

**Thornshell (Shield):**
- **Priority 1:** T7 Flat Damage Reflected to Attackers (12-20) - Core reflect scaling
- **Priority 2:** T7 Health (66-110) - Core survivability 
- **Alternative:** T7 +Level of Judgement (1-2) or T7 % Fire Damage (31-42%)

### **Weapon Options Crafting:**

**Transcriber's Graver (Weapon):**
- **Priority 1:** T7 +Level of Judgement (1-2) - Direct skill scaling is extremely powerful
- **Priority 2:** T7 Attunement (8-12) - Universal scaling for both damage types
- **Alternative:** T7 Cast Speed (15-20%) or T7 Flat Fire Spell Damage (10-18)

**Special Behavior:** Provides +24 spell damage and +20% elemental penetration. The penetration affects both Judgement fire damage and any elemental reflects. We don't use the Fire Aura mechanics - this is purely for the spell damage and penetration stats.

### **Glove Options Crafting:**

**Wing Guards (Attack Speed Focus):**
- **Priority 1:** T7 +Level of Judgement (1-2) - Direct skill scaling beats general stats
- **Priority 2:** T7 Health (66-110) - Survivability 
- **Alternative:** T7 Attunement (8-12) for universal scaling

**Special Behavior:** 40% melee attack speed affects Judgement casting speed. 28% chance to gain Haste (30% movement speed) for 1 second on hit with Judgement. Cannot deal critical strikes, but this doesn't affect our build since we don't focus on crits.

**Hand of Judgement (Attunement Focus):**
- **Priority 1:** T7 +Level of Judgement (1-2) - Stacks with the +16 Attunement implicit
- **Priority 2:** T7 Health (66-110) - Survivability
- **Alternative:** T7 % Fire Damage (31-42%) for damage focus

**Ravenous Void (Defense Focus):**
- **Priority 1:** T7 Health (66-110) - Stacks with defensive mechanics
- **Priority 2:** T7 All Resistances (15-21%) - Maximal defense
- **Alternative:** T7 Attunement (8-12) to maintain damage scaling

**Special Behavior:** Generates Void Barrier stacks (5% less damage each, max 3 = 15% less damage taken) while above endurance threshold. Below threshold, stacks double temporarily then convert to damaging Mimic Feast. We primarily want this for the massive defensive potential, not the complex void mechanics.

### **Boot Options Crafting:**

**Advent of the Erased (DOT Protection):**
- **Priority 1:** T7 Health (66-110) - Core survivability
- **Priority 2:** T7 +Level of Judgement (1-2) - Primary skill scaling
- **Alternative:** T7 Attunement (8-12) or T7 Cast Speed (15-20%)

**Special Behavior:** Gains Haste (30% movement speed) for 3 seconds when nearby enemies die, with 35% less DOT damage taken while you have Haste. Also grants Ward (30-60) when gaining Haste and gives minions Haste/Frenzy. We don't use minions, but the DOT protection and Haste generation are excellent for our positioning-dependent build.

### **Belt Crafting:**

**Immolator's Oblation (Self-Ignite):**
- **Priority 1:** T7 Health (66-110) - Essential survivability
- **Priority 2:** T7 Mana Gained on Vengeance Hit (12-20) - Resource management
- **Alternative:** T7 +Level of Judgement (1-2) or T7 All Resistances (15-21%)

**Special Behavior:** 100% chance to ignite yourself when using Judgement, gaining +2 spell damage per ignite stack on you (up to 20 stacks = +40 flat fire spell damage). Also chance for Frenzy per ignite stack. The 100% ailment cleanse on potion use prevents ignite from killing you. This massive flat spell damage bonus is a core damage multiplier.

### **Ring Crafting:**

**Red Ring of Atlaria (Chase Defense):**
- **Priority 1:** T7 Health (66-110) - Stacks with all defensive mechanics
- **Priority 2:** T7 +Level of Judgement (1-2) - Primary skill scaling
- **Alternative:** T7 Flat Fire Spell Damage (10-18) or T7 Attunement (8-12)

**Special Behavior:** Provides +4-5 to ALL attributes and 10% less damage taken if you have 180+ total attributes. The "all attributes" helps reach the threshold easily, making this both offensive and defensive.

**Flames of Midnight (Spirit Generation):**
- **Priority 1:** T7 Health (66-110) - Survivability priority
- **Priority 2:** T7 +Level of Judgement (1-2) - Primary skill scaling
- **Alternative:** T7 Attunement (8-12) for universal scaling

**Special Behavior:** Replaces Evade with Spirit Step and grants permanent Swiftness (20% movement speed). Creates Wandering Spirits when you use Judgement (4 second cooldown), which provide +7 ward per second each and deal fire damage. The spirits are autonomous minions we benefit from passively.

**Sunwreath (Fire Focus):**
- **Priority 1:** T7 +Level of Judgement (1-2) - Primary skill scaling
- **Priority 2:** T7 Attunement (8-12) - Enhances existing fire damage
- **Alternative:** T7 Health (66-110) for survivability

**Special Behavior:** Provides ignite chance and fire damage over time. The Flame Reave modification is irrelevant to our build - we use this purely for the fire damage stats and ignite synergy with other items.

### **Relic Crafting:**

**Twisted Heart of Uhkeiros (Spell Levels):**
- **Priority 1:** T7 +Level of Judgement (1-2) - Stacks with the +1 Elemental implicit
- **Priority 2:** T7 Health (66-110) - Core survivability  
- **Alternative:** T7 All Resistances (15-21%) for defense

**Special Behavior:** Converts 5-8% of current health to ward when casting Judgement, and provides +1 to all Elemental spell skill levels (including Judgement). The health-to-ward conversion gives us an additional defensive layer that scales with our health pool.

**Soulfire (Ignite Synergy):**
- **Priority 1:** T7 +Level of Judgement (1-2) - Primary skill scaling
- **Priority 2:** T7 Health (66-110) - Survivability
- **Alternative:** T7 % Fire Damage (31-42%) or T7 Attunement (8-12)

**Special Behavior:** Provides 100% increased armor while ignited (synergizes with Immolator's Oblation) and 10% more spell damage to ignited enemies. Since we ignite ourselves, we constantly have increased armor. The Hungering Souls conversion is irrelevant - we use this for the ignite synergies.

### **Crafting Priority Philosophy:**
1. **+Level of Judgement first** - Direct skill scaling is the highest value for our primary damage skill
2. **Flat Damage Reflected second** - Massively more powerful than Attunement for reflect scaling
3. **Health third** - T7 Health for survivability across all builds
4. **Attunement fourth** - Universal scaling but less impactful than direct skill levels
5. **Specialized stats fifth** - Cast Speed, % Fire Damage, resistances based on build focus

**With proper crafting, unique items become exponentially more powerful than their base versions, often rivaling or exceeding perfectly crafted rare items.**

- **T7 % Increased Health** (15-21%)
- **T7 Attunement** (8-12 points)
- **T7 All Resistances** (15-21%)
- **T5+ Cast Speed** if available

---

## **Progression Path**

### **Early Game (Level 20-50):**
1. Focus on basic Attunement stacking
2. Acquire Thornshell (any roll)
3. Craft "Mana Gained on Vengeance Hit" belt
4. Use any shield until Thornshell drops

### **Mid Game (Level 50-80):**
1. **Priority 1:** Thicket of Blinding Light (farm until found)
2. **Priority 2:** Start collecting Weaver reflect idols
3. **Priority 3:** Basic unique items (Transcriber's, Wing Guards)
4. Begin crafting T5+ gear pieces

### **End Game (Level 80+):**
1. **Perfect Thornshell** (9% reflect per Attunement)
2. **Complete Weaver idol collection**
3. **Chase items** based on variant choice
4. **T7 crafted gear** with perfect affixes
5. **Optimize variant** for specific content

---

## **Variant Recommendations by Content**

### **Campaign/Story:** Optimal variant
### **Monolith Farming:** Max Thorns variant  
### **Boss Rushing:** Max Judgement variant
### **Hardcore:** Max Survivability variant
### **Speed Farming:** Max Damage variant

### **Endgame Scaling:**
All variants scale excellently into endgame with proper gear, but each excels in different scenarios. The modular nature means you can swap between configurations by changing 2-4 items depending on your current goals.

**The Optimal variant provides the best balance for players who want one setup that handles all content effectively.**

---

## **Combat Rotation & Gameplay**

### **General Rotation:**
1. **Activate Holy Aura** at area start (maintain active buff)
2. **Spam Judgement** to create overlapping consecrated grounds
3. **Use Vengeance** when low on mana or to prepare ripostes
4. **Position aggressively** to trigger Thicket blind effect on enemies
5. **Consume Symbols of Hope** for emergency ward/damage reduction

### **Boss Fighting:**
1. **Pre-cast consecrated grounds** before boss spawns
2. **Stay in melee range** for Thicket blind + Thornshell reflects
3. **Alternate Judgement spam** with Vengeance for mana sustain
4. **Stack consecrated grounds** under boss for maximum DOT
5. **Use mobility skills** to maintain positioning

### **Key Mechanics:**
- **Attunement scales everything:** Judgement damage/healing AND reflect damage
- **Consecrated ground stacks:** Multiple zones = exponential healing/damage
- **Thicket blind effect:** Must stay close to enemies for boss damage multiplier
- **Vengeance ripostes:** Active reflect damage when timed correctly
- **Self-ignite synergy:** Immolator's Oblation provides massive spell damage bonus

---

## **Pros & Cons**

### **Pros:**
- **Dual damage sources** - Active fire DOT + passive reflects
- **Unified scaling** - Attunement improves offense, defense, AND utility
- **Multiple viable configurations** - Adaptable to any content or playstyle  
- **Excellent survivability** - Built-in healing + multiple defensive layers
- **Unique gameplay** - Combines active casting with tactical positioning
- **Great scaling** - Performs well from league start to endgame optimization

### **Cons:**
- **Gear dependent** - Requires specific unique items to reach full potential
- **Active playstyle** - Must manage positioning, mana, and multiple buffs
- **Primordial slot locked** - Thicket of Blinding Light limits other Primordial choices
- **Complexity** - Multiple mechanics to understand and optimize
- **Item chase** - Perfect variants require rare/expensive items

---

## **Why This Build Works**

### **Mechanical Synergies:**
1. **Judgement builds already use Vengeance** - Adding reflects makes existing rotation more valuable
2. **Attunement double-dips** - Same stat scales damage AND survivability 
3. **Fire theme consistency** - All damage sources benefit from fire scaling
4. **Defensive layering** - Healing + reflects + positioning create multiple safety nets

### **Power Level Analysis:**
- **Early Game:** Strong with basic Attunement focus
- **Mid Game:** Very strong once core items acquired
- **End Game:** Extremely powerful with proper optimization
- **Ceiling:** Among the highest potential builds with perfect gear

**This hybrid approach should outperform pure Judgement OR pure reflect builds by combining their strengths while covering their individual weaknesses.**

---

## **Power Analysis: Crafted vs Non-Crafted**

### **The Crafting Revolution:**
The ability to add T7 affixes to unique items fundamentally transforms this build's power ceiling:

**Non-Crafted Uniques:** Standard power level, often with "dead" stats
**Crafted Uniques:** Become extremely powerful, rivaling perfect rare items

### **Stat Comparison Example:**
**Thornshell (Base):** 23% Block Chance + 425 Block Effectiveness + 90 Reflect Damage + 9% per Attunement
**Thornshell (Crafted):** All of the above + 110 Health + 42% Fire Damage = **Becomes a god-tier item**

### **Total Power Gain from Crafting:**
- **+800-1000 Health** across all unique items
- **+100-120 Attunement** from crafted affixes alone  
- **+90+ Flat Fire Spell Damage** from optimized crafting
- **+250+ % Fire Damage** potential across items
- **Resource management** (mana on Vengeance hit, resistances)

### **Build Power Scaling:**
- **Base Build:** Good performance with just mandatory items
- **With Basic Uniques:** Very strong with Wing Guards, Transcriber's, etc.
- **With Chase Uniques:** Extremely powerful with Red Ring, Flames of Midnight
- **With Perfect Crafted Items:** Potentially broken - among the strongest builds possible

**The crafted unique combinations create a build that should significantly outperform both the original Shaman reflect build AND the pure Judgement build, while being substantially tankier than either.**
