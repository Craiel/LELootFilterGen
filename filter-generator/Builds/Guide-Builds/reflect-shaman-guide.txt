The Reflect Shaman embraces the ancient power of the wild to become a thick Spriggan. Twisted bark hardens into armor, roots dig deep into the earth, and every blow struck against this guardian is turned back upon its enemies. With thorns bristling and sap flowing like blood, the Spriggan thrives in the heart of battle, reflecting pain and punishment onto all who dare to stare at him.

Spam Thorn Shield to spawn Maelstroms and watch everything die around you while they try to get through your impenetrable bark skin. Eterra's Blessing automatically procs every time you cast Thorn Shield for sustain while Summon Spriggan offers you amazing defensive buffs.

This setup needs 
Thicket of Blinding Light, 
Tears of the Forest and 
Thornshell to function. Additionally, Items like 
Hazelroot, 
Hand of Judgement, 
Legacy of the Quiet Forest and 
Bloodkeeper's Nest are incredible for the build.

Overall this is an amazing Shaman build that performs well in endgame, even in Hardcore. If you are looking for the ultimate reflect fantasy and the truly afk porcupine build, then this is the perfect setup for you!

Hand of Judgement comes with a 16 Attunement Implicit and for that reason is used as a stat stick.
Legacy of the Quiet Forest helps with Rage sustain.
Bloodkeeper's Nest grants a huge DPS buff as you cast more Thorn Shields. Alternatively, you can go for a Cold Spriggan Form Ward Variant of the build that uses 
Twisted Heart of Uhkeiros instead.
Stack Reflect Idols to boost your Damage. The Flat Reflect Damage they provide is extremely important for your DPS.
Red Ring of Atlaria boosts Attunement and Resistances while also providing amazing Damage Reduction. Double-stacking them amplifies the defensive benefit.

Defense
Reflect Damage has many unique traits that set it apart from all other types of damage in Last Epoch. Reflect Damage does not Hit and instead directly reduces Health and Ward without going through damage calculations.
Reflect Damage does not apply Ailments or Leech Health.
Reflect Damage doesn’t have a Damage type tag, it is simply ‘Damage’. If an enemy deals Cold Damage and has high Cold Resistance, the Reflect Damage isn't affected by the enemy's Cold Resistance
Reflect Damage ignores all enemy mitigations except for more/less/increased Damage Taken Modifiers (like the ones in the Monolith of Fate). It ignores: Resistances, Armor, Endurance, Block, Dodge, Glancing blow and the Damage Reduction enemies gain from area level.
Reflect Damage cannot be scaled by regular Modifiers (increases to Global Damage, specific types, etc).
