The Judgement Paladin creates Consecrated Ground with Judgement, to burn enemies with holy fire. Become the Judge and cleanse your foes of impurity, as they hopelessly try to break through your immense defenses.

The Judgement Paladin deals Fire Spell Damage Over Time with Consecrated Ground and generates Mana with Vengeance. Consecrated Ground also grants great Healing, since multiple of them can stack on top of each other. Use Holy Aura and Symbols of Hope for great passive buffs. Healing Hands grants Ward and Healing, while acting as your Movement Skill.

This setup doesn't require any Uniques to function. However, items like
Transcriber's Graver,
Wing Guards,
Rahyeh's Light,
Immolator's Oblation and
Twisted Heart of Uhkeiros turn this build into an absolute powerhouse, capable of dealing amazing DPS while being absurdly tanky.

Overall this powerful Paladin is an amazing build that performs well in endgame, even in Hardcore. If you are looking for a holy warrior that destroys enemies and is able to survive the hardest encounters, this build is perfect for you!
