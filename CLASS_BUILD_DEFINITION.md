# Powerful Class Build Structure Guide

## Core Build Philosophy

A powerful Last Epoch build follows a focused approach where all systems work together to maximize effectiveness while maintaining survivability and utility. Every build must balance offense with defense to handle endgame content effectively.

## Essential Build Components

### 1. Primary Damage Focus
- **Single Core Ability**: Choose ONE skill to be your primary damage dealer
- **Specialization Priority**: This skill MUST be one of your 5 specialized skills
- **Resource Allocation**: Majority of passive points should support this ability
- **Scaling Focus**: All damage scaling should prioritize this skill's damage type

### 2. Supporting Skill Framework
- **Enhancement Skills**: 1-2 skills that directly boost your core ability
- **Utility Skills**: Skills that provide necessary functions (movement, defense, etc.)
- **Specialization Limits**: Remember you only have 5 specialization slots total

### 3. Mastery Selection Strategy
- **Main Mastery**: Choose based on your core damage skill location
- **Cross-Mastery Access**: Utilize first 2 skills from other masteries for support
- **Passive Synergy**: Ensure your chosen mastery's passive tree supports your build

## Defensive Strategy Framework

### Base Defense Requirements
Every build needs a foundation of survivability:

- **Health**: Minimum 2,500-3,000 HP for endgame content
- **Health Regeneration**: Provides consistent recovery
- **Ward** (if applicable): High-capacity ward with retention for burst protection

### Primary Defense Selection
Choose ONE primary defensive strategy to focus on:

#### Armor-Based Defense
- **Target**: 10,000+ armor rating (77%+ damage reduction)
- **Strengths**: Consistent physical damage reduction
- **Weakness**: Only 70% effective vs non-physical damage
- **Item Priority**: Armor rating on gear, armor passives

#### Dodge-Based Defense
- **Target**: 10,000+ dodge rating (80%+ dodge chance)
- **Strengths**: Complete avoidance of attacks
- **Weakness**: All-or-nothing protection
- **Item Priority**: Dodge rating, movement speed

#### Block-Based Defense
- **Target**: High block chance + 5,000+ block effectiveness (70%+ reduction)
- **Strengths**: Reliable partial damage reduction
- **Weakness**: Requires shield or specific weapons
- **Item Priority**: Block chance, block effectiveness rating

### Secondary Defense (Resistance)
**MANDATORY** for all builds:

- **Resistance Cap**: Achieve 75% in all relevant resistances
- **Over-Cap**: Consider 85-90% total resistance for endgame (10-15% over-cap)
- **Priority Order**:
    1. Elemental Resistances (Fire, Lightning, Cold)
    2. Physical Resistance
    3. Poison, Necrotic, Void (based on content)

### Tertiary Defense (Optional)
- **Endurance**: Useful for builds with consistent health levels
- **Additional Ward**: Supplementary protection for casters
- **Damage Over Time Mitigation**: Specialized protection as needed

## Build Structure Template

### Core Damage Layer

- **Primary Skill**: Your main damage dealer
    - Specialization Tree: Maximize damage nodes first
    - Passive Support: Mastery tree focused on this skill
    - Item Priorities: Gear that scales this skill


### Defense Layer

- **Primary Defense**: Choose Armor/Dodge/Block
    - Rating Target: 10,000+ for endgame effectiveness
    - Passive Investment: 15-25% of total points
    - Item Requirements: Defensive stats on gear

- **Resistance Defense**: MANDATORY
    - All Resistances: 75% minimum, 85-90% preferred
    - Over-cap Strategy: Account for enemy penetration
    - Gear Priority: Resistance rolls on accessories

- **Base Health**: 2,500+ HP minimum
    - Health on gear: Life rolls on armor pieces
    - Health passives: Generic tree investments
    - Health Regeneration: Sustain mechanisms

## Passive Allocation Strategy

### Main Mastery Tree (No Restrictions)
- **Core Damage Scaling**: 50-60% of available points
- **Defensive Nodes**: 25-35% of available points
- **Utility/QoL**: 10-15% of available points

### Other Mastery Trees (First Half Only)
- **Cross-mastery skill support**: Key nodes for supporting abilities
- **Additional defense**: Supplementary survivability options
- **Resistance sources**: Alternative resistance scaling

### Class Generic Tree
- **Universal survivability**: Health, regeneration, general defense
- **Broad damage scaling**: Universal damage increases
- **Utility nodes**: Movement speed, resource management

## Item Priority Framework

### Offensive Priorities (60-70% of item budget)
1. **Primary skill scaling** (damage type, skill levels, etc.)
2. **Critical strike** (if applicable to build)
3. **Attack/cast speed** (DPS multiplication)
4. **Penetration** (enemy resistance reduction)

### Defensive Priorities (30-40% of item budget)
1. **Resistances** (75%+ in all relevant types)
2. **Primary defense rating** (armor/dodge/block effectiveness)
3. **Health** (2,500+ total)
4. **Health regeneration** (sustain)

### Utility Priorities
- **Movement speed** (30%+ total)
- **Mana/resource management** (if needed)
- **Quality of life** (pickup radius, etc.)

## Build Validation Checklist

### ✅ Offense Requirements
- [ ] One clear primary damage skill identified and specialized
- [ ] All passive points contribute meaningfully to damage or survivability
- [ ] Supporting skills enhance rather than compete with core ability
- [ ] Scaling focuses on single damage type/method

### ✅ Defense Requirements
- [ ] Primary defense strategy chosen and scaled (10,000+ rating)
- [ ] All resistances at 75% minimum (preferably 85-90%)
- [ ] Minimum 2,500+ health achieved
- [ ] Defense scaling doesn't sacrifice more than 40% of total passive budget

### ✅ Utility Requirements
- [ ] Movement skill or 30%+ movement speed included
- [ ] Resource management addressed (mana, etc.)
- [ ] Quality of life improvements considered

### ✅ System Optimization
- [ ] All 5 specialization slots used effectively
- [ ] Mastery selection maximizes available synergies
- [ ] Passive point allocation follows game restrictions
- [ ] Item priorities balance offense and defense appropriately

## Common Build Mistakes

### Offensive Mistakes
1. **Split Focus**: Trying to scale multiple damage types equally
2. **Wasted Specializations**: Specializing unused skills
3. **Passive Inefficiency**: Points in nodes that don't benefit the build

### Defensive Mistakes
1. **No Primary Defense**: Relying only on health and resistances
2. **Resistance Gaps**: Missing key resistances for content
3. **Under-investment**: Less than 25% of resources in survivability
4. **Over-capping Wrong Stats**: Exceeding caps without benefit

### System Mistakes
1. **Cross-Mastery Overreach**: Trying to access restricted content
2. **Specialization Waste**: Not utilizing all 5 specialization slots
3. **Item Imbalance**: Too much focus on offense OR defense

## Build Effectiveness Benchmarks

### Damage Benchmarks
- **Campaign**: Consistent clear speed with reasonable gear
- **Early Endgame**: Can handle monolith progression smoothly
- **High Corruption**: Maintains DPS while surviving difficult content

### Defense Benchmarks
- **Resistances**: 75% minimum, 85-90% for high corruption
- **Primary Defense**: 70%+ effective damage reduction or avoidance
- **Health Pool**: 2,500+ HP minimum, 3,500+ preferred for endgame
- **Sustain**: Consistent health/ward recovery mechanisms

**Remember**: The most powerful build is one that can consistently clear the content you want to play. Perfect balance between offense and defense creates builds that are both effective and enjoyable to play.
